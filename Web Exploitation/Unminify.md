#  picoCTF 2024 - Unminify (Easy)

##  Challenge Description  
Something seems to be hidden in this webpage! Inspect the source code and see what you can find.  

[You can access the challenge here](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/278?category=1&difficulty=1&page=1).  

##  Hints  
- Inspecting the **source code** of websites can sometimes reveal hidden information.  
- **Minified (compressed)** code can be difficult to read, but formatting it properly can help.  

---

##  Solution  

1. **Inspecting the Source Code**  
   - I opened the page's **source code** using the "View Page Source" option (`Ctrl + U`).  
   - I noticed that the source code was **written in one line and minified**.  

2. **Formatting the Code**  
   - I adjusted the alignment by **dragging the code to the right** to make it more readable.  
   - This allowed me to spot the hidden flag.  

3. **Finding the Flag**  
   - Within the source code, I discovered the following flag:  

     ```
     picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_b99eb82e}
     ```

## Conclusion  
This challenge helped me understand **how to analyze minified and poorly formatted code**.
