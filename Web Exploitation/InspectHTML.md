## Solution  

1. **Inspecting the Source Code**  
   - I viewed the page's HTML code by right-clicking and selecting **"View Page Source"** (or pressing `Ctrl + U`).  
   - Alternatively, I used the **Inspect Element** (`F12` key) to examine the HTML structure.  

2. **Finding the Flag**  
   - While inspecting the source code, I noticed that the **flag was hidden inside the HTML**.  
   - The flag was clearly visible in the code:
