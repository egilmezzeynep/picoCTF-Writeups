## 🔍 Solution  

1. **Inspecting the Page Source**  
   - I opened the page source (`Ctrl + U` or right-click and select **"View Page Source"**).  
   - In the source code, I noticed references to **style.css** and **script.js** files.  

2. **Searching for the Flag in External Files**  
   - I checked the **style.css** file and found the first part of the flag:  
     ``` 
     picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_
     ```
   - I then examined the **script.js** file and found the second part:  
     ```
     f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
     ```

3. **Combining the Flag**  
   - After putting both parts together, I got the final flag:  

     ```
     picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
     ```
