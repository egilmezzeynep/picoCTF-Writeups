# picoCTF - Web Exploitation: Scavenger Hunt

## Challenge Description  
In this challenge, we need to examine different files and page sources to find the hidden flag. The flag is split into multiple parts and hidden throughout the website.  

---  

## ðŸ•µSolution Steps  

###  1. Checked the Page Source  
First, we inspected the **page source** and found **the first part of the flag**:  picoCTF{t


Additionally, some **interesting files** stood out: **mycss.css** and **myjs.js**.  

---  

### 2. Checked the CSS File  
By inspecting **mycss.css**, we found **the second part of the flag**:  h4ts_4_l0


However, **myjs.js** did not contain any flag-related information.  

---  

###  3. Checked the Robots.txt File  
One of the hints mentioned **"How do I prevent Google from indexing my website?"**. This suggested checking the **robots.txt** file.  
We visited **http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/robots.txt** and found **the third part of the flag**:  t_0f_pl4c


When investigating a website, always check for **robots.txt and .htaccess** files.  

---  

###  4. Checked the .htaccess File  
Next, we examined the **.htaccess** file and discovered **the fourth part of the flag**:  

3s_2_lO0k


---  

###  5. Considered the MacOS Hint  
One of the hints stated, **"I love making websites on my Mac. I store a lot of information there."**  

This suggested checking for a **.DS_Store** file. MacOS stores directory information in **.DS_Store**, and it might have been accidentally uploaded to the server. Upon inspection, we found **the final part of the flag**:  

_35844447}


---  

##  Final Flag  
After combining all the parts, the complete flag is:  
  ```
picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_35844447}
  ```
