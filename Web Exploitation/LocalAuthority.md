## Description  
Who is this **admin** person everyone is talking about?  

[Access the challenge here](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/278?category=1&difficulty=1&page=1).

## Hints  
- How does a website know that you are logged in?  
- Try looking at the **cookies** stored by the website.

## Solution  

1. **Inspecting the Page Source**  
   - Opened the **page source** to analyze the website's structure.  
   - Noticed a reference to `login.php` in the code and clicked on it.  
   - This led me to the source of **login.php**.

2. **Key Findings**  
   - In the `login.php` source, two interesting files caught my attention:  
     - `secure.js`  
     - `admin.php`  

3. **Analyzing `secure.js`**  
   - Opened `secure.js` and found the login credentials:  
'''
username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765'
'''


4. **Checking `admin.php`**  
- `admin.php` source did not reveal useful information, but I already had valid login credentials.

5. **Logging In**  
- Used **admin** as the username and **strongPassword098765** as the password on the login page.  
- Successfully logged in and obtained the flag:
