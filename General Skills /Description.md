In this challenge, we need to **establish an SSH connection and solve a number guessing game**.  

---

## ðŸ•µ Solution Steps  

### 1. Extracting the ZIP File  
First, I **unzipped the provided ZIP file** and examined its contents.  

Inside, there was a **Python script that generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it**.  
The script continues until the user **correctly guesses the number**.  

---

###  2. Establishing an SSH Connection  
I used the **Linux terminal to establish an SSH connection**:  

```bash
ssh -p 58039 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net
```

After entering "yes" to proceed, I entered the given password:

Password: 
```
84b12bae
```

Once connected, the number guessing game started!
 3. Playing the Guessing Game

The game required guessing a number between 1 and 1000.
I used the binary search approach to efficiently narrow down the possibilities.
 My Guesses:

    500 â†’ Lower (The correct number is smaller)
    250 â†’ Higher (The correct number is larger)
    350 â†’ Lower
    300 â†’ Higher
    325 â†’ Lower
    315 â†’ ðŸŽ‰ Correct guess!

 Final Flag

After winning the game, I received the following flag:
```
picoCTF{g00d_gu355_2e90d29b}
```

Note: Since the number is randomly generated, your guesses might be different!
